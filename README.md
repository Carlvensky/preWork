## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had some issues connecting my local Git to Github; I didn't create the repository first, then clone it. What I did was create a local folder to do the work. I thought I was gonna be able to push it into any repository I wanted, but in the end, I had to go on GitHub and paste the file manually.
